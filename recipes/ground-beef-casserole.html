    <h3>Grandma's ground beef casserole</h3>
    <p>
      Nobody makes casserole like your Grandma. That's why this old-fashioned
      ground beef casserole with egg noodles is always such a hit! It's made
      with ingredients you already have on hand (and, of course, a little bit of
      love).
    </p>
    <ul>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
      <li>2 (15 ounce) cans tomato sauce</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) package egg noodles</li>
      <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
      <li>3 ounces cream cheese, softened</li>
      <li>1 large white onion, diced</li>
      <li>Â½ cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese, or more to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <li>
        Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef in
        the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and
        discard grease.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix tomato sauce, sugar, garlic salt, and salt into the ground beef;
        simmer until flavors blend, about 20 minutes. Remove from the heat,
        cover the skillet, and cool to room temperature.
      </li>

      <li>
        While the sauce is cooking, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to
        a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally
        until cooked through but firm to the bite, 7 to 9 minutes. Drain.
      </li>

      <li>
        While the egg noodles are cooking, preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175
        degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch casserole dish.
      </li>

      <li>Mix sour cream, cream cheese, and onion together in a bowl.</li>

      <li>
        Layer 1/2 of the egg noodles into the prepared casserole dish. Top with
        1/2 of the sour cream mixture, then 1/2 of the ground beef mixture.
        Repeat layers once more. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese over top.
      </li>

      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and golden brown, 25
        to 30 minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
