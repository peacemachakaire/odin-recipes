    <h3>Homemade Mac and Cheese</h3>
    <p>
      This homemade mac and cheese recipe uses a classic mixture of sharp
      Cheddar and Parmesan. Cheddar is a fantastic base, while Parmesan adds a
      more complex and salty flavor. Of course, you can adapt this recipe to
      suit your taste: Gruyere, Monterey Jack, and Gouda are all great options
      for macaroni and cheese.
